# remote_irc_notify
Simple, secure, lightweight notification system using MQTT over TLSv1.2 to forward hilight notifications from remote IRC client (weechat) to local notifier daemon.

Using TLSv1.2 for encryption and authentication of subscribers and publisher.

## STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS
 * The proof of concept is functionnal.
 * Weechat plugin should be working.
 * MQTT server configuration is good

### TODO
 * Add deploy script
 * Provide proper code and cmdline for local notifier
 * Update plugin for better management (commands and settings must be added)
